# 2048 Clone

## Synopsis

A recreation of the 2048 app using HTML5 Canvas. The only thing not written by me is the [seeded random](https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom).

**Note:** This uses grid CSS for the layout, so if it does not work, you may need to update your browser.

## Live Code

A live version of the game can be found at https://curtisfulton.github.io/2048-Clone. This is still in development and will be updated more as time goes on.

## Skills/Technologies

- Grid CSS
- HTML5 Canvas
- Javascript
- Prototypes

## Motivation

I started this project to get more familiar with javascript in general. My programming background comes from statically typed languages such as C#, so I didn't feel as confident as I would like in Javascript. 

I also intended to use this project to train a neural network to play 2048. Originally this was going to be in the same project, but the complexity started to get too high, so I will start a new project for the neural network.
